I am a full stack Mobile App Developer with experience building with Jetpack Compose for Android, Flutter and Dart for cross platform application.I have been able to work on projects that demonstrate my skill ranging from a device tracking system to a note application, an inventory management system and a fintech app. 

I am keen on bringing my skillset and willingness to learn plus my teamwork spirit to whatever team I join so as to push the company's vision forward. 

I am currently seeking entry level opportunities as a mobile app dev.
